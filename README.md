## 🚀 Suggestions for use:
Enjoy creating a grid and placing a rover to navigate over a plateau! 
* Create a plateau up to 10 x 10 or start using the default plateau and rover.
* Place a rover on the plateau or start navigating using the default.
* Navigate a rover with a series of instructions.

## ⌨️ Assumptions:
* The plateau may not exceed a 10 x 10 grid.
* The rover may not ever move off the plateau grid.

## ✌️ Good to know:
* The creation of the mars rover relied on user testing and does not encompass unit tests.
* The rover is represented by an arrow pointing towards the rover's heading.
